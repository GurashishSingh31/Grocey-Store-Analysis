# Grocery Store Data Analysis

This project explores a dataset from a grocery store and performs various data preprocessing, data wrangling, feature engineering, and predictive modeling tasks. The goal is to predict certain outcomes based on the provided features and analyze the importance of each feature for prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various products sold at a grocery store, including attributes like item identifier, item weight, item visibility, item type, item MRP (Maximum Retail Price), outlet identifier, outlet establishment year, outlet size, outlet location type, and outlet type. The dataset also includes the target variable, which is the item outlet sales.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw dataset and preprocessed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, data wrangling, feature engineering, modeling, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Preprocessing and Wrangling

The data preprocessing and wrangling steps involve handling missing values, standardizing categorical variables, handling outliers, and performing any necessary data transformations. These steps ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis and modeling.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the predictive power of the model. This step may include creating interaction variables, binning continuous variables, encoding categorical variables, and extracting relevant information from text or date features.

## Modeling

The project includes the implementation of a predictive model using gradient boosting regression. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, and the R2 and RMSE scores are computed to evaluate its performance. The R2 score measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, while the RMSE score quantifies the average deviation between the predicted and actual values.

## Feature Importance Analysis

To understand the importance of each feature for prediction, the project includes an analysis of feature importance. This analysis highlights the relative contribution of each feature in the predictive model and can provide insights into which features have the most significant impact on the target variable.

## Results and Findings

The project aims to provide insights into the predictive power of the model, the performance metrics (R2 and RMSE scores), and the relative importance of each feature. The findings can help understand the key factors influencing grocery store sales and guide decision-making processes.
